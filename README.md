A fast data grid that can handle millions of rows

The grid attempts to use commonly known spreadsheet mechanics, but has been optimized to accomodate large data sets, at the expense of some flexibility.  For example, formulas, formats, and styles are defined for whole columns, not for individual cells.  Header cells are selectable - row/col operations like sorting, moving, hiding, and showing are managed by arrow commands entered while a header cell is selected. See the guide for keyboard controls.
